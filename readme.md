## Description

Search Analytics is a WordPress plugin that will keep history of the search terms used by your users and group them in a set of statistics including the number of posts resulted from that search term.

## Installation

Search Analytics can be installed via the WordPress Automatic Plugin Install page in the admin panel.
It can also be downloaded from the [Search Analytics Plugin Page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search-analytics) and installed manually.

After the installation and activation is complete you should visit the plugin's settings page ( Settings -> MWT: Search Analytics ) to make sure it is properly configured for your needs.

## Feature Requests

For now, you can use the [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/search-analytics). I will be adding a feature request/voting system to the [www.cornelraiu.com plugin page](https://www.cornelraiu.com/mwt-search-analytics/) soon so everything will be kept in there.

Also, you can visit the plugin's [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/MvIWInjW). This should give you an overview on my plans regarding this plugin.
